# Face-Verification-and-Recognition

### Overview:
Face recognition problems commonly fall into two categories:

- Face Verification - "is this the claimed person?". For example, at some airports, you can pass through customs by letting a system scan your passport and then verifying that you (the person carrying the passport) are the correct person. A mobile phone that unlocks using your face is also using face verification. This is a 1:1 matching problem.
- Face Recognition - "who is this person?". For example, the video lecture showed a face recognition video of Baidu employees entering the office without needing to otherwise identify themselves. This is a 1:K matching problem.

FaceNet learns a neural network that encodes a face image into a vector of 128 numbers. By comparing two such vectors, you can then determine if two pictures are of the same person.

- Face verification solves an easier 1:1 matching problem; face recognition addresses a harder 1:K matching problem.
- The triplet loss is an effective loss function for training a neural network to learn an encoding of a face image.
- The same encoding can be used for verification and recognition. Measuring distances between two images' encodings allows you to determine whether they are pictures of the same person.
